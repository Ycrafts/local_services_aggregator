here is the flow for the local_services_aggregator api
1. Customer posts a job with the type of job it is.(job types have table of their own) 
2. System notifies the best fits (matching the job type id from the customers skill filled out in the pivot table provider_profile_job_type table)(many to many jobs_types to provider_profile
3. Providers express interest. (updating the is_interested field in the requested_jobs table to true from the default false)
4. Customer selects from the interested providers

Fixes:
The status tracking and signal system has to be done all over again has too much mess. Needs to be centralized.

Other functionalities:
Notifications when a job is found for the provider.
Notifications for a customer when a job is accepted
Rating System when a job is completed.(A job is marked as completed either when a customer confirms or it has been 24 hours since the completion of it as reported by the provider.)
